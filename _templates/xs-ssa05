## ⚠️️Special Attention   ⚠️️

**Do not connect AC power and the serial connection at the same time** 

12 July 2023 Update:
- Old template doesn't make sense at all even with older firmware. Updated template, tested with Tasmota 13.0.0
- To flash, open up the case, and the pads are at the BOTTOM side. Luckily all of them are near the edge and can be accessed without removing the board.
- Solder 3V3, GND, TX, RX, and Ground IO0 pin during flash
- DISCONNECT FROM MAIN POWER before connecting to the serial-USB adapter!!
- Can be flashed via [Web Flasher](https://tasmota.github.io/install/)
- For more accurate energy consumption measurements this device requires [power monitoring calibration](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Power-Monitoring-Calibration/)
